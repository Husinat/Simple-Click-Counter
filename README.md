# Simple Click Counter

A beginner-friendly JavaScript project that allows users to increase, decrease, and reset a numerical counter using buttons. This project was built to practice core JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, event listeners, and basic logic.

## Project Purpose

This project was created as part of my JavaScript practice to help me understand how JavaScript interacts with HTML elements on a webpage. It focuses on handling user interactions and dynamically updating content without reloading the page.

---

## Features

- Increase the counter value
- Decrease the counter value
- Reset the counter to zero
- Dynamic text messages based on user actions
- Color changes to reflect increase, decrease, and reset actions
- Simple and clean user interface

---

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – for structuring the page
- **CSS** – for styling the layout and buttons
- **JavaScript** – for functionality and interactivity

---

## What I Learned

## Through this project, I learned and practiced:

How to select HTML elements using getElementById

How to use addEventListener to handle button clicks

How to update text dynamically using textContent and innerHTML

How to apply styles dynamically with JavaScript

How increment (++) and decrement (--) operators work

The difference between post-increment (x++) and pre-increment (++x)

Writing simple conditional logic using if statements

Organizing JavaScript code for better readability

## Future Improvements

## Some ideas to improve this project in the future:

Prevent the counter from going below zero

Save the counter value using localStorage

Add animations to button clicks

Improve the UI with better styling
